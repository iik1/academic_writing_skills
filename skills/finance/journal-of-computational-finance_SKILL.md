# Journal Writing Skill: Journal of Computational Finance

## Journal Profile
- **ABS 2024 Rating:** 1
- **Field:** FINANCE
- **Publisher:** Infopro Digital (Risk.net / Risk Journals)
- **Scope:** International peer-reviewed journal on numerical and computational techniques in the pricing, hedging and risk management of financial instruments — finite-difference/finite-element methods, Monte Carlo and quasi-Monte Carlo simulation, free-boundary problems, and related numerical analysis. Heavily quantitative/algorithmic rather than empirical-econometric.
- **Guidelines URL:** https://www.risk.net/static/risk-journals-submission-guidelines (shared across all Risk Journals titles, including this one); journal landing page https://www.risk.net/journal-of-computational-finance
- **Field baseline:** finance-field-writing-style
- **Articles spot-checked:** 10 (abstracts/titles): "Analytical and Monte Carlo swaption pricing under the forward swap measure" (Kawai, 2002); "A shrinking horizon optimal liquidation framework with lower partial moments criteria" (Anis & Kwon, 2020); "Second-order Monte Carlo sensitivities in linear or constant time" (Daluiso, 2020); "Extremal risk management: expected shortfall value verification using the bootstrap method" (Malecka, 2020); "Pricing American call options using the Black–Scholes equation with a nonlinear volatility function" (Grossinho, Kord & Sevcovic, 2020); "An artificial neural network representation of the SABR stochastic volatility model" (McGhee, 2021); "Expansion method for pricing foreign exchange options under stochastic volatility and interest rates" (Nagami, 2021); "Deep learning for discrete-time hedging in incomplete markets" (Fecamp et al., 2021); "Quantization-based Bermudan option pricing in the foreign exchange world" (Fayolle et al., 2021); "Finite-difference solution ansatz approach in least-squares Monte Carlo" (Huo, 2025). Access limited to abstracts and metadata via publisher pages and RePEc/IDEAS; full text is paywalled, so structural observations below rely on visible front matter only.

## Hard Constraints (Author Guidelines)
> These override FIELD_SKILL where they conflict. Note: these are drawn from the shared Risk Journals submission guidelines page, which applies uniformly to this and sibling Risk.net journals (Journal of Risk, Journal of Energy Markets, etc.) — they are not unique to this title, but they do override the FIELD_SKILL defaults.

### Structure
Title page (with running header ≤50 characters, word count, figure/table count) submitted separately from the blinded main text. Main text order: Figure/Table legends, Abstract, Keywords, Key messages, Title, blinded body text, Declarations & Acknowledgements (conflict-of-interest statement required), References. Recommended body section sequence: Introduction, Literature review, Data, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion — this generic empirical-paper template is a suggestion from the shared guidelines, not evidence of what computational/numerical-methods papers in this journal actually use (see Structural Deviations below).

### Length
Research papers: 10,000 words maximum. Forum papers: 7,000 words maximum. No word/page limit appears in FIELD_SKILL — this is a hard numeric ceiling specific to Risk Journals.

### Abstract
Single paragraph, 150–200 words (narrower and with an explicit floor+ceiling vs. FIELD_SKILL's looser 150–250 words), stating purpose, principal results, and conclusions, with no references.

### Citations
In-text: author-date, Chicago Manual of Style. Reference list: APA format, alphabetical by author, DOIs included where applicable. Same author-year convention as FIELD_SKILL, but the mixed Chicago-in-text/APA-reference-list detail is a Risk Journals-specific formatting instruction not present in FIELD_SKILL.

### Headings
Not separately specified beyond the recommended section sequence above; standard numbered headings observed in practice (Follows FIELD_SKILL norm).

### Tables and Figures
Legends collected separately near the front of the submission package; figures/tables required both in the main PDF and as separate editable files (vector graphics preferred: EPS, SVG, or PDF from Office apps; 300dpi minimum if raster). Keep quantity minimal. This front-loaded legends placement and dual-file submission requirement is a Risk Journals-specific production rule, not covered by FIELD_SKILL.

### Explicit Prohibitions
No prior publication or simultaneous submission elsewhere. AI-tool use in drafting must be disclosed, with each tool and its specific use specified; AI use is limited to data extraction, background research, and editing assistance. No substantial author changes at proof stage except error correction. Published papers may not be reposted online (e.g., no free posting of the final published PDF).

## Observed Deltas from FIELD_SKILL

### Voice and Register
Follows FIELD_SKILL norm, adapted to numerical/methods framing: abstracts foreground the computational method and its properties ("proposes," "presents an approach to improve accuracy and stability," "constructs an ansatz") rather than an economic research question or identification strategy. This is a natural consequence of the journal's scope (computational/numerical methods papers, not reduced-form empirical finance) rather than a stated stylistic rule — PRACTICE ONLY.

### Statistical Reporting
Not applicable in the FIELD_SKILL sense (regression coefficients, clustering, significance stars). Sampled abstracts instead emphasize numerical performance claims — accuracy, stability, computational efficiency/speed, mean-squared-error reduction — as the equivalent "results" vocabulary. PRACTICE ONLY / FIELD DEFAULT for this journal's subfield; not a deviation the field baseline anticipates since FIELD_SKILL is written for empirical/econometric finance papers.

### Citation Density
Abstracts sampled show no delta from FIELD_SKILL patterns visible at front-matter level (too little full-text access to assess introduction-section density). Follows FIELD_SKILL norm as far as observable.

### Structural Deviations
The shared Risk Journals guidelines recommend a generic empirical template (Introduction, Literature review, Data, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion). Sampled article titles/abstracts (all on numerical/pricing methods, no "Data" section implied by scope) suggest most JCF papers do not have a "Data" section in the FIELD_SKILL/guidelines sense, and likely use a "Model," "Numerical method," and "Numerical results/experiments" structure instead — consistent with a computational-methods journal rather than an empirical-data journal. This is inferred from scope and titles rather than confirmed full-text structure, so flagged as PRACTICE ONLY / low-confidence, not a stated norm.

### Other Journal-Specific Patterns
The 2025 sampled article page displays a distinct "Key Takeaways (Need to Know)" bullet block matching the guidelines' "Key messages" requirement (3–4 short bullets). This is ENFORCED — stated in the shared guidelines and confirmed present on a live 2025 article page.

---

## Dimensions With No Delta
- Voice and person: FIELD DEFAULT (adapted to methods framing per above, but no formal deviation)
- Hedging conventions: FIELD DEFAULT (not assessable from abstracts alone; no evidence of deviation)
- Conclusion structure: FIELD DEFAULT (not assessable from abstracts alone; no evidence of deviation)
- Citation format (author-date in text): FIELD DEFAULT, with Risk Journals-specific Chicago/APA hybrid detail noted above as a formatting HARD_CONSTRAINT rather than a voice delta

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Using the generic guidelines' suggested "Data" section when the paper is purely a numerical-methods contribution with no empirical data section — sampled titles suggest most published papers substitute a Model/Methodology/Numerical Results structure instead.
- Omitting the separate "Key messages" bullet block (3–4 bullets, ≤85 characters each) — this is a Risk Journals-specific requirement distinct from the abstract and is visibly rendered on article pages.
- Exceeding the 150–200 word abstract band (tighter than the general FIELD_SKILL 150–250 word range).
- Forgetting to submit figures/tables as separate editable vector files in addition to the main PDF.

## Avoiding AI-Writing Patterns

<!-- academic-humanizer:start v0.3.3 -->
These conventions apply regardless of field or journal. Apply them in addition to everything above; only deviate where this journal's own guidelines explicitly require otherwise. One exception within this section: in a funding proposal, Layer 6 overrides the paper-mode trimming of ambition language.

*Merged from academic-humanizer v0.3.3 (MIT License, AIScientists-Dev), which builds on humanizer by blader (MIT); full license text in THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md of the academic_writing_skills repository.*

### Core principle and scope

Improve the clarity and voice of AI-assisted *academic* writing while keeping the precise, evidence-bound voice that scholarship requires and matching the author's own style. Preserve every number, result, and citation. This is not a tool for evading AI-use disclosure.

**Scope.** Editing or reviewing academic prose: paper sections, abstracts, rebuttals, related work, and **funding proposals** (NSF Project Summary/Description, NIH Specific Aims, ERC, NFR, fellowship and foundation proposals; see Layer 6). **Not** for blogs, marketing, or personal essays, and **never** inject opinion, humor, or first-person "personality" into a manuscript. For technical writing, neutral and precise *is* the human voice. One caveat for proposals: their register is different from a paper's, since they are sold on vision and feasibility, so the ambition language a paper would trim is appropriate there; apply Layer 6, not the paper layers' stricter trimming, to vision statements.

**Core principle.** Academic writing already has a correct human voice: neutral, precise, third-person plural ("we"), every claim tied to its evidence. The job is to (1) strip the AI *tells* without casualizing, and (2) enforce the discipline a general humanizer misses: **every claim earns its number, figure, or citation, and no verb is stronger than its evidence.**

### Process

1. **Read** the manuscript and any author writing sample; note the document type (paper vs. funding proposal) and the target venue or funding agency. For proposals, also apply Layer 6 and preserve appropriate vision.
2. **Audit** (do not edit yet): list each detected pattern with its location and proposed fix, and each empirical claim's evidence status.
3. **Rewrite**: same structure and content, all claims and citations preserved, tells removed, over-claims matched to evidence, legitimate hedging kept.
4. **Report**: cleaned text plus a short change log (patterns removed, claims softened or given evidence pointers, voice notes). Cover everything the original covered: if it had five paragraphs, so does the rewrite. See Output below.

### Layer 1: General AI tells

Scan for and fix these general patterns, subject to the academic exceptions in Layer 3. Connectives, vague quantities, formulaic openers, emphasis openers, hedging, and novelty claims are covered in Layer 2.

1. **No participial result clauses.** Findings should not carry an "-ing" tail asserting an interpretation the sentence has not earned ("...rose by 12 points, highlighting the importance of enforcement"; "...underscoring the need for validation"; "...demonstrating that norms shifted"). State the finding. If the implication is worth stating, state it as its own sentence.
2. **Limit rule-of-three constructions.** An occasional triple is fine ("clear, concise, and compelling"); a triad in every paragraph is a tell, and so is a triple added as padding. Vary the structure.
3. **Replace importance-inflation words with the actual magnitude.** Avoid "crucial," "critical," "pivotal," "vital," "paramount," "invaluable," "essential" as importance markers, inflated significance ("marking a pivotal moment"), and "dramatically" as an intensifier. Avoid "vast," "myriad," "plethora." State the size of the effect instead of asserting its importance. For "significantly," see 2.1.
4. **Avoid the 2023-era word list.** "Delve," "explore" (as metaphor), "unpack," "navigate," "landscape," "realm," "tapestry," "testament," "journey," "harness," "leverage," "unlock," "foster," "bolster," "garner," "showcase," "boast," "underscore," "pivotal," "seamless," "holistic," "multifaceted," "nuanced," "intricate," "interplay." Also avoid "robust" outside its statistical sense and "comprehensive" as self-description.
5. **No promotional or figurative language.** Avoid "rich," "vibrant," "groundbreaking," and similar praise or imagery for any subject. Describe it plainly. (For praise of your own contribution, see 2.4.)
6. **No empty balance.** Avoid "while challenges remain," "a double-edged sword," "strikes a balance," "it is not without limitations," "both approaches have merits": these simulate judgment without making one. Do not open more than one or two sentences per section with a concessive "While X, Y" construction.
7. **No vague attributions.** Avoid "experts argue" and similar attributions with no citation attached. Cite the source or cut the attribution.
8. **No anthropomorphised prose.** Avoid "the data tell a story," "the analysis paints a picture," "this paper seeks to," "the results speak to."
9. **No padding verb phrases or copula avoidance.** Replace "serves to," "serves as," "acts as," "stands as," "functions as," "is able to," "in order to," "due to the fact that," "utilize," "prior to," "commence" with their one-word equivalents ("serves as" -> "is").
10. **No wrap-up restatement.** A conclusion should add the implication or end. It should not repeat what was just said via "Taken together, these results suggest...," "In sum," or "In conclusion" followed by a restated summary.
11. **No elegant variation.** Do not cycle synonyms for one referent. Pick one term and keep it.
12. **Vary rhythm.** Avoid clustering sentence lengths in a narrow band, making every paragraph roughly equal, or opening every section the same way. Split overlong, clause-stacked sentences (2.11).
13. **No chatbot leakage.** Avoid "Certainly," "Here's," "Let's examine," "we can see that," "as mentioned above": residue from copy-pasted chat output.
14. **No em dashes.** Remove em dashes (the long dash, U+2014) entirely. Recast with a period, comma, colon, or parentheses, or split into separate sentences, whichever the sentence actually calls for.
15. **No antithesis padding or negative parallelisms.** Avoid the "X, not Y" contrast construction as a rhetorical flourish ("a correlation, not a coincidence"; "a policy shift, not a technical adjustment") and "not just X, but Y" unless the contrast is doing real argumentative work and stated once.
16. **No fillers.** Cut "basically," "essentially," "simply," "just," "really," "very," "quite," "actually" unless the sentence fails without them.
17. **No flourish labels.** Do not bold or set off rhetorical labels like "The Bottom Line:," "Key Insight:," "Takeaway:," "Bottom line," "The upshot." State the point in the sentence itself. Structural run-in labels in a funding proposal (6.4) are not flourish labels.
18. **No topic-announcing openers.** Avoid "This section discusses...," "This paper will discuss...," "Let's turn to...," "We now turn our attention to...." Open with the content itself.

**Before:** *Additionally, an enduring testament to the method's value is its ability to delve into intricate dependencies, showcasing a seamless integration that underscores its pivotal role.*
**After:** *The method also captures higher-order dependencies, which the baselines miss (Table 2).*

### Layer 2: Academic AI tells (remove or fix)

#### 2.1 Over-claiming verbs
Empirical work *shows* and *provides evidence*; it does not *prove* or *demonstrate* universal truths.
**Watch:** demonstrate, prove, establish, confirm, guarantee. Use "significantly" only for a stated statistical test, with the test and its result; never as an intensifier.
**Before:** *We prove that our method significantly outperforms all prior approaches.*
**After:** *Our method improves held-out accuracy by 4--7 points over the strongest prior approach (Table 3); the gain is significant at p < 0.01 by a paired test.*

#### 2.2 Significance hype
**Watch:** paves the way for, a crucial/pivotal step toward, has the potential to revolutionize, opens new avenues, sheds light on, of paramount importance, bridges the gap.
**Before:** *This work paves the way for a new paradigm and sheds light on a problem of paramount importance.*
**After:** *This work addresses one failure mode of prior methods: error accumulation under long-horizon rollout (Section 4).*

#### 2.3 Empty intensifiers and vague quantities
**Watch:** extensive/comprehensive/thorough experiments, a wide range of, a range of, a number of, several key, numerous, various, "numerous studies" without citations attached. Give the count or the citation.
**Before:** *We conduct extensive experiments on a wide range of datasets.*
**After:** *We evaluate on three datasets (ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and iNaturalist).*

#### 2.4 Novelty padding and self-praise
Never characterize your own contribution as "novel," "innovative," "unique," "cutting-edge," "state-of-the-art," or "groundbreaking," and drop "to the best of our knowledge" and "for the first time." Say what the work addresses that prior work does not, and let the reader judge novelty. This holds in funding proposals too: Layer 6 keeps vision language, not self-labels.
**Before:** *We propose a novel framework and, to the best of our knowledge, are the first to study this.*
**After:** *We study online calibration under delayed labels, which prior calibration work (offline) does not address.*

#### 2.5 Formulaic and throat-clearing openers
**Watch:** "In recent years, X has attracted increasing attention"; "In recent years, there has been growing interest in..."; "With the rapid development of..."; "With the advent of..."; "In today's rapidly evolving..."; "Despite recent advances,...". Delete and start with the claim.
**Before:** *In recent years, tabular deep learning has attracted increasing attention.*
**After:** *Tabular deep learning has a structural limitation: most models discard feature-type metadata and must relearn it from data.*

#### 2.6 Connective overuse
Do not start a sentence with "Moreover," "Furthermore," "Additionally," "In particular," "Ultimately," "Overall," "In essence," "Indeed," or "That said," whether or not the previous sentence did. Transitions belong inside the argument, not bolted onto it; let logic carry.
**Before:** *Moreover, the method is fast. Furthermore, it is simple. Additionally, it scales.*
**After:** *The method is fast and simple, and it scales to one million rows (Section 5).*

#### 2.7 Contribution-list cliches
Each contribution names a *specific* result, not a restatement of the abstract.
**Before:** *Our contributions are: (1) a novel method; (2) extensive experiments; (3) strong results.*
**After:** *We (1) introduce a metadata-aware encoder that reaches 0.91 AUROC vs 0.86 for the strongest baseline; (2) show it stays within 2 points under 20% label noise where the baseline drops 9; (3) release the benchmark.*

#### 2.8 Citation dumping
Cite the one or two works that matter and say why, not a bracketed list.
**Before:** *Many methods exist [3, 7, 9, 12, 15].*
**After:** *The closest prior method is TabNet [7], which encodes all features jointly; we instead condition on feature-type metadata.*

#### 2.9 Hedging: cut empty hedges, keep evidence-tied ones
Cut hedges that carry no specific, defensible qualification: "somewhat," "relatively," "fairly," "quite," "arguably," "to some extent," "in some sense," "it could be argued," "seems to," "may potentially." Quantify or cut. Keep evidence-tied hedging, which is correct and required: "suggests," "is consistent with," "we hypothesize that," "may indicate," "appears to" when the claim is genuinely uncertain. Hedge only where the uncertainty is real, and specify its source. Never upgrade a calibrated verb.
**Before:** *Performance is somewhat better and relatively robust.*
**After:** *Accuracy is 3 points higher and varies by less than 1 point across five seeds.*
*Wrong fix:* turning *"the results suggest X"* into *"the results prove X"*: this manufactures over-claiming. Keep the calibrated verb.

#### 2.10 Boilerplate emphasis and interpretive openers
**Watch:** "It is worth noting that", "It should be emphasized that", "Notably,", "Importantly,", "Interestingly,", "Surprisingly,", "Strikingly,". If it matters, the sentence shows it; if the fact is surprising, the reader will notice.
**Before:** *It is worth noting that, importantly, the gain holds across scenarios.*
**After:** *The gain holds across all three scenarios (Table 4).*

#### 2.11 Overlong, clause-stacked sentences
AI favors long sentences that chain three or four clauses with commas and "which", "that", "while", "with". Split them: one idea per sentence, and cut subordinate clauses that carry no weight. **Watch:** sentences past ~30 words, or with 3+ subordinate clauses.
**Before:** *Existing methods, though promising, are largely empirical, with unclear principles underpinning their behavior, which limits their reliability and further progress.*
**After:** *Existing methods stay empirical. Their principles are unclear, which limits reliability and progress.*

### Layer 3: Preserve these (do NOT over-correct)

A general humanizer flattens legitimate scholarly constructs. Keep them.

- **Evidence-tied hedging is correct and required** (2.9). Keep the calibrated verb when the claim is genuinely uncertain.
- **Passive voice** is fine when the actor is irrelevant: *"Samples were normalized to total protein."*
- **First-person plural "we"** is standard; do not rewrite to avoid it.
- **Semicolons and an occasional triple** are fine in moderation (Layer 1, item 2). Em dashes are the exception: remove them entirely (Layer 1, item 14), recasting with commas, colons, parentheses, or separate sentences.
- **Formal definitions, named methods/metrics, technical terms, equations, and symbols** stay verbatim.
- **Never invent, drop, or alter a number, equation, or citation.** Same content; preserve every cite key.

### Layer 4: Claim-evidence discipline

For every empirical claim, check (a) is it backed by a number, figure, table, or citation in the text, and (b) does the verb match the strength of that evidence?

- **Unbacked claim -> add the evidence pointer or soften.**
  *Before:* *Our method is more robust.*  *After:* *Our method's accuracy drops by 2 points under distribution shift, versus 11 points for the baseline (Figure 3).*
- **Verb stronger than evidence -> downgrade.**
  *Before:* *This demonstrates that our method is universally superior.*
  *After:* *On these three datasets, our method matches or exceeds the strongest baseline (Table 2).*
- **Vague magnitude -> a number or RANGE, attributed.**
  *Before:* *a large improvement.*  *After:* *a 2--6% improvement in balanced accuracy over the strongest baseline.*
  Prefer ranges (e.g., "2--6%") over single averaged values unless the averaging method is stated, and attribute each number to its method, metric, and baseline. When comparing, lead with the comparison against the strongest competitor, not the trivial baseline.

### Layer 5: Voice and venue matching

If the author supplies prior papers, read a sample first and note sentence rhythm, connective habits, level and placement of hedging, how they open sections, notation, and recurring phrasings, then match them. Match the venue's register too: this skill's own voice and register guidance above defines it (in a field skill, "Voice, Person, and Register"; in a journal skill, the journal profile, hard constraints, and observed deltas), and that guidance wins over any generic register default. Absent a sample, default to clean, precise, venue-appropriate prose, not the casual, opinionated voice of a general-purpose humanizer.

### Layer 6: Funding-proposal mode (NSF, NIH)

Apply this layer only to funding proposals. The structure notes below cover NSF and NIH; the same discipline applies to other funders (e.g., ERC, NFR). In a paper, nothing in this layer relaxes the rules above.

A proposal is not a paper. It is sold on **vision plus feasibility**, not on finished results, and reviewers score it. The register shift matters: ambition language that the paper layers would trim ("long-term goal", "pioneer", "transformative", "establish a foundation") is *appropriate and expected* here, provided a credible plan and evidence back it. So in proposal mode, **do not flatten the vision**; enforce a different discipline instead: **claim <-> feasibility**.

#### 6.1 Know the structure; the score lives in the first pages
Reviewers form a score from the opening, then skim the rest to confirm it. Put most editing effort there.
- **NSF.** A one-page **Project Summary** with the three review-criteria heads spelled out: **Overview**, **Intellectual Merit**, **Broader Impacts**, each self-contained. The Project Description then opens with **long-term vision -> this proposal's goal -> the gap -> the specific thrusts/aims -> the payoff**, ideally within the first 1--2 pages, with one overview figure. Broader Impacts must be substantive and integrated, never an afterthought.
- **NIH (R01).** The **Specific Aims page is the whole proposal in one page**, and is the most-read, most-decisive page. Standard arc: (1) opening: the problem, what is known, the **gap / critical need**; (2) the **long-term goal** and the **central hypothesis** with its rationale; (3) "**The objective of this application is...**" plus how the hypothesis was formed; (4) **2--3 Aims**, each a one-line goal + a phrase on approach + the expected outcome; (5) a **payoff** paragraph: what changes if it succeeds. Then **Significance, Innovation, Approach** as separately scored sections.

#### 6.2 First-3-pages primacy (edit these hardest)
By the end of page 1 (NIH Aims) or pages ~2--3 (NSF), the reader must already hold: the **hook** (why it matters, concretely), the **gap** (what is missing and the cost of the gap), the **central idea** (your approach in one sentence), the **aims/thrusts** (crisp and parallel), and the **payoff**. If any is missing or buried, fix that before touching later sections. A reviewer unconvinced by page 3 does not recover on page 10.

#### 6.3 Proposal-specific weak moves to fix
- **Vague importance.** *Watch:* "this is an important/timely problem", "X has many applications".
  **Before:** *Understanding this problem is critically important.*
  **After:** *Without bounds on how measurement noise propagates to diagnosis, clinical models are tuned by trial and error, the inefficiency this proposal removes.*
- **Method-as-aim** (an aim naming a technique instead of a question or outcome).
  **Before:** *Aim 2: Apply transfer learning to the dataset.*
  **After:** *Aim 2: Determine whether fusing wearable and lab signals improves early detection, and for which patient subgroups it helps or hurts.*
- **Dominoed aims** (Aim 2/3 collapse if Aim 1 fails; reviewers flag this as fragile). *Fix:* phrase aims as **parallel and independently valuable**; where one depends on another, state the fallback.
- **Ambition without feasibility.** Every bold claim needs a footing: preliminary data, a prior result/publication, a classical theorem you build on, or a collaborator/letter. *Fix:* attach the evidence beside the claim ("our preliminary result in Fig. X shows...", "building on a classical minimax lower bound...").
- **Boilerplate Broader Impacts / training plan.** *Watch:* "we will mentor students and disseminate via talks and papers." *Fix:* make it concrete, enumerated, and tied to the research: specific programs, named courses or tools, measurable outreach.
- **Hedged central hypothesis.** The Aims-page hypothesis is a falsifiable commitment, not "we will explore whether possibly...". Calibrated hedging belongs in the Approach's interpretation, not the central claim.

#### 6.4 Preserve and deploy (funded-proposal craft)
These read as strength; keep or add them rather than editing them out.
- **Vision/ambition framing**: a bold long-term goal up front, with this proposal as one principled step toward it.
- **Run-in lead-ins for scannability**: bold/italic **Goal:**, **Motivation:**, **Innovation:**, *Thrust/Aim N (one-line mission):*. Reviewers skim; visible structure earns time.
- **A concrete running example or protagonist** to make an abstract method vivid and consistent across aims.
- **Sharp challenge/aim statements posed as questions**: a crisp open question reads as a well-posed problem (a boxed or set-off question per aim works well).
- **Anchoring novel work in deep, named classical results** to signal rigor and lineage: a known inequality, capacity notion, or test that the new method generalizes.
- **Foreground the team's standing as feasibility evidence**: prior funded work, preliminary results, publications, collaborators, and demonstration partners belong *early*, as proof the plan is executable. A real track record is evidence, not boasting; place it where it de-risks the aims. *(Use only the PI's own real, supplied record; never invent funding, results, partners, or letters.)*

#### 6.5 Claim <-> feasibility (the proposal analog of Layer 4)
For every aim and promised outcome, check: is the ambition matched by a credible means, such as preliminary data, a prior method, a classical foundation, a collaborator, or staged de-risking? If yes, keep the ambitious verb. If no, attach the missing evidence or scale the claim to what the plan supports. Never invent preliminary results, prior funding, partners, or letters; if the support does not exist, flag the gap for the author rather than papering over it.

### Output

Return the cleaned text plus a short change report: patterns removed (by type), claims softened or given evidence pointers, and any voice/venue notes. Confirm that no number, equation, or citation was altered.
